This is the README.md for this directory. 

The point of this is just for me to keep a record/document/code for wargames found on overthewire.org. 

It's a cool website used to learn concepts of computer security through wargames. 

If you want to do them yourself, I don't recommend going further as I'll be writing my notes for the games. The best way to learn is by struggling yousrself.

Unless you want to see my thoughts or compare my answers to yours, then you can just go right ahead. 

_Here's_ _to_ _learning!_
